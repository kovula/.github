# KOVULA /

KOVULA is an open space to explore, learn and shape ideas into dependable
tools and robust environments.

Experience and a preference for proven methods set the direction, while
curiosity drives the exploration. This dynamic centers on guiding principles
of clarity, maintainability and the avoidance of unnecessary complexity.

The name carries no intended meaning and was chosen for being short and free
of existing associations. It is pronounced «ko-view-luh».

This space collects code, configurations, and tooling used across a set of
self-hosted services and personal infrastructure. It is a quiet, pragmatic
workspace focused on clarity, reliability, and iterative refinement.
