# KOVULA /

KOVULA is an open space to explore, learn, and shape ideas into dependable
tools and robust environments.

The emphasis is on practicality, led by curiosity grounded in experience and
a preference for proven approaches. Clarity, maintainability and the avoidance
of unnecessary complexity are the guiding principles.

The name carries no intended meaning and was chosen for being short and free of
existing associations. It is pronounced “ko-view-lah” — /ˈkoʊ.vjuː.lə/.

This space collects code, configurations, and tooling used across a set of
self-hosted services and personal infrastructure. It is a quiet, pragmatic
workspace focused on clarity, reliability, and iterative refinement.
