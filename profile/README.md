# KOVULA /

**KOVULA** is an open space to explore, learn, and shape ideas into dependable
tools and robust environments.

It encourages a practical, no-nonsense mindset — valuing proven solutions over
fashionable trends.

Everything here grows from curiosity, hands-on learning, and the satisfaction
of building things that work: explicit, maintainable, and free of distracting
complexity.

The name has no intended meaning and is pronounced “ko-view-lah” — /ˈkoʊ.vjuː.lə/.

This space collects code, configurations, and tooling used across a set of
self-hosted services and personal infrastructure. It is a working environment
focused on clarity, reliability, and iterative refinement.

If you find anything useful here, feel free to explore. KOVULA is a quiet place
to build, experiment, and keep things in good shape — nothing more complicated
than necessary.
