# KOVULA /

**KOVULA** is an open space to explore, learn, and turn ideas into dependable
tools and robust environments. It is guided by a practical, no-nonsense mindset
that values what is proven over what is fashionable. Everything grows from
curiosity, hands-on learning, and the enjoyment of building things that work by
being explicit, maintainable, and free of distracting complexity.

The name has no intended meaning and no specific origin. It was chosen for its
clear, simple sound rather than for any reference or association.

This space collects code, configurations, and tooling used for a set of
self-hosted services and personal infrastructure.

If you find anything useful here, feel free to explore. KOVULA is a quiet place
to build, iterate, and keep things in good shape — nothing more complicated
than necessary.
