# KOVULA /

KOVULA is an open space to explore, learn and shape ideas into dependable
tools and robust environments.

Experience and proven methods set the direction, while curiosity drives
exploration. This dynamic centers on the principles of clarity,
maintainability and simplicity.

The name carries no intended meaning and was chosen for being short and
free of existing associations. Pronounced «ko-view-luh», it is stylised
with terminal-inspired symbols and a trailing slash to denote a workspace or
directory.

This space collects code, configurations, and tooling used across a set of
self-hosted services and personal infrastructure.
